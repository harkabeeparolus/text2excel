# Contributing to text2excel

Please feel free to send a pull request.  ðŸ™‚

Make sure to read the [README](README.md) for general installation
instructions.

* To edit the source code, make sure to install into a virtual environment!

There are some __TODO:__ comments in the source that indicate a wishlist of
sorts, or planned upcoming features.

## Git

[text2excel]: https://github.com/harkabeeparolus/text2excel

The source code for [text2excel] is on Github.

I will assume that you are using a personal `~/.config/git/ignore` to avoid
checking in your editor or IDE files. If you are not certain what this means,
please check the well-written guide here:

## Poetry and Package Dependencies

[Poetry]: https://python-poetry.org

First, make sure you have [Poetry] installed.
You can use the official
[Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation),
or just run `pipx install poetry`.

Use [Poetry] to install and manage your virtual environments and package
dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harkabeeparolus/text2excel.git
cd text2excel
python3 -m venv .venv
poetry install
```

If prompted to upgrade _pip_ to the latest version, please do so:

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade-strategy eager --upgrade pip setuptools
```

### Upgrading Dependencies

To upgrade the packages to the latest versions, and generate a new
*requirements.txt*, simply:

```bash
poetry update
poetry export -f requirements.txt >requirements.txt
```

Make sure to do `poetry run pytest`, and then check in:

* pyproject.toml
* poetry.lock
* requirements.txt

## Coding Style

You can use any coding style you want, as long as it's [Black]. ðŸ˜‰

[Black]: https://black.readthedocs.io/

## Code Quality

Test your code. We use [pytest]. Write new tests as necessary, and please
test your code before checking in.

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Use [pylint], [Flake8] and [black] before checking in your code:

```bash
black text2excel
poetry run pylint text2excel
flake8 text2excel
```

[pytest]: https://pytest.org/
[pylint]: https://www.pylint.org
[Flake8]: https://flake8.pycqa.org/

* I should setup automated testing with
  [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/)
  or [nox](https://github.com/theacodes/nox)

### pre-commit

To partially automate linting, we use [pre-commit].

```bash
pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Packaging text2excel

If you want to bundle up *text2excel* into a single, standalone executable Python
[zipapp], I highly recommend [shiv]. For example:

```bash
shiv -o text2excel -p "/usr/bin/env python3" -c text2excel text2excel
```

If _shiv_ doesn't work for you for some reason, you can also use [PEX]:

```bash
pex -o text2excel -c text2excel text2excel
```

[pipx]: https://github.com/pypa/pipx
[shiv]: https://github.com/linkedin/shiv
[PEX]: https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex
[zipapp]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html

## Getting Python Software with pipx

[pipx]: https://github.com/pypa/pipx

I suggest installing all utilities with [pipx] -- pipx is great! ðŸŒŸ

To install or upgrade _pipx_, either follow the official
[_installation guide_](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/),
or just run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade-strategy eager --upgrade pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

At this point, you may need to logout to refresh your shell `$PATH` before
proceeding.

Then you can install stuff such as **pre-commit**, **black** or **shiv** using
pipx!

```bash
pipx install poetry
pipx install black
pipx install pylint
pipx install flake8
pipx install shiv
pipx install pre-commit
```

To automagically upgrade all your pipx packages, run:

```bash
pipx upgrade-all
```

And if you are having trouble ðŸ’£, such as after a Python major version
upgrade, just reinstall:

```bash
pipx reinstall-all
```

### Upgrading pipx (and Other PyPI Packages)

To see if you have any outdated pip packages that need upgrading, run:

```bash
python3 -m pip list --outdated
```

Then, if necessary, to upgrade **pipx** itself, just re-run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade-strategy eager --upgrade pipx
```

Also, you should upgrade **pip** itself this way, or **setuptools**, whenever
there is a newer version.
